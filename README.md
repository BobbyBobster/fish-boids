# Boids
From the [boids wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids):
> Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds, and related group motion.

This is a demo implementation of boids in the form of a school of fish.
I wrote it mainly to be able to take a look at [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

The demo has controls to influence the behaviour of the boids. I might add some
extras in the future, like a shark-boid which scares away the other fish.
